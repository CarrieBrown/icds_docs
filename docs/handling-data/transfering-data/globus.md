## Globus

Globus is a web-based tool designed for robust, large scale file transfers between established
endpoints. ICDS has established endpoints on Roar Collab, Archive, and OneDrive. Many other 
institutions have their own established endpoints, and users can set up personal endpoints on 
their own machines, allowing for direct file transfers between any of these points.

To get started, go [here][globus].

ICDS endpoint names:

| Filesystem | Endpoint |
| ---- | ---- |
| Collab | PennState_ICDS_RC |
| Archive | PennState_ICDS_Archive |
| PSU OneDrive | "Penn State ICDS OneDrive" |

To navigate to other locations on RC or Archive, change the "Path" field.

To see shared collections and files on OneDrive, go up one folder from the start location.


## Shared Collections

Globus collections can be used to share files from their work and group directories to others 
through the Globus interface.
