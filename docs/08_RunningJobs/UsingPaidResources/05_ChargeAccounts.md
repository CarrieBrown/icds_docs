# Charge accounts

To submit batch jobs on any but [vintage](03_ComputeHardware.md) hardware, 
a paid charge account is required.
Faculty can set up charge accounts, for one or more groups or projects,
with a list of approved users, funded by a given source.

Charge accounts are "pay as you go":
the account is charged only when compute jobs run.
Jobs are priced in "compute units" (CUs). 
One CU equals one core-month on a basic node.

CUs from an allocation can be spent on any type of node,
so that you can use whatever hardware is needed for a given job.

To sign up for a charge account, use [iLab][iLab].
After you fill out the web form,
including a funding source from SIMBA,
ICDS staff will confirm the account by email.
Once the account is active,
you can add CUs or authorized users via iLab.
